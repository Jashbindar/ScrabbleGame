# Scrabble Game (AI)

A command-line Scrabble game in Python where you play against an AI bot. The game simulates the classic Scrabble experience, allowing you to play words, exchange tiles, and compete for the highest score.

## Features

- **Player vs AI:** Play against a computer-controlled opponent.
- **Tile Bag & Rack:** Simulates the real Scrabble tile bag and rack system.
- **Word Validation:** Checks words against a dictionary file (`dic.txt`).
- **Scoring System:** Calculates scores based on standard Scrabble letter values.
- **Tile Exchange:** Option to exchange tiles if you can't play a word.
- **Multiple Rounds:** Choose how many rounds to play.

## Getting Started

2. Ensure `Scrabble_Game(AI).py` and `dic.txt` are in the same folder.
3. Open a terminal and run:
